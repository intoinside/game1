A personal experiment to learn how to do a game with Commodore 64

## Purpose
This game is born as a personal experiment to learn C64 assembly language. The experiment covers charset redefinition, map draw, sprite definition, draw and collision detection, joystick control.
I've used CBM .prg Studio ([main site](https://www.ajordison.co.uk/)).
